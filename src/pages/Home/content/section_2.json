        "One of the most common beginner mistakes is buying fish impulsively without considering their needs. Unfortunately, this often leads to frustration when the fish die within a month. Most healthy aquarium fish should live at least 2–3 years, but only if they are chosen wisely and properly cared for. Instead of picking the most colorful or active fish in the store, take time to research their requirements.",
        "The first step is ensuring the fish are compatible with your tank’s size, water parameters, and existing inhabitants. Some species need plenty of swimming space, while others prefer densely planted environments. Certain fish thrive in groups, while others are territorial and require careful pairing. Ignoring these factors can lead to stress, aggression, and early death.",
        "When selecting fish, observe their behavior in the store. Healthy fish are active but not frantic, have clear eyes, and show no signs of disease, such as torn fins or white spots. Ask about their diet and adult size — many fish are sold as juveniles and can outgrow small tanks quickly.",
        "Choosing wisely from the start saves you money, prevents unnecessary deaths, and makes fishkeeping more enjoyable. Our detailed articles guide you through species selection, tank compatibility, and fish care to ensure your aquarium is filled with vibrant, long-living fish. Take the time to choose right, and you’ll enjoy a beautiful, thriving aquarium for years!"
